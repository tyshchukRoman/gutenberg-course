# Codelibry Starter Template (SASS Guide)

The Sass directory is organized into several subdirectories, 
each serving a specific purpose in the development of your WordPress project. 

- 📁`sass` 
    - 📁`abstracts`     - contains Sass tools like variables and mixins.
    - 📁`base`          - holds foundational styles and resets.
    - 📁`blocks`        - styles for specific website sections.
    - 📁`components`    - ui-component styles (e.g., buttons, cards).
    - 📁`layout`        - layout-related styles (e.g., grids, headers).
    - 📁`pages`         - page-specific styles.
    - 📁`utilities`     - utility classes for margins, paddings, etc.
    - 📁`vendor`        - third-party CSS styles.
    - 📄`main.sass`     - main entry point for compiling Sass files.



## What files, we should visit when starting a new project:
You can read descriptions in files how to work with them.

### 1) `abstracts/_breakpoints.scss` (here we set our breakpoints if we don't have all the necessary here)
### 2) `abstracts/_colors.scss`      (here we set our colors)
### 3) `base/_font-face.scss`        (here we connect our fonts into css)
### 4) `abstracts/_typography.scss`  (here we set our typography)
### 5) `abstracts/_sizes.scss`       (here we set our sizes: margins, paddings, gaps)
### 6) `abstracts/_tokens.scss`      (here we set a lot of settings which will apply to different utilities and components)


### After that a lot of work is already done. Then just go and explore files we have to know what they do
